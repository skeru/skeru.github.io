<h2>Course projects proposals</h2>

<p>Please refer to your course professor to ask about available course project proposals.
I usually propose projects about C++ arithmetics and/or LLVM compiler framework.
Here you can find additional details on some (not all) of those projects.
</p>

<h3>Advanced Computer Architectures / Code Transformation and Optimization</h3>
<p>The following projects can be taken for both courses.
The effort required to accomplish those projects may differ depending on which course you are attending.</p>

<ul>
 <li> llvm-mca [<a href="ACA/ACA_llvm-mca.pdf">description</a>]</li>
 <li> [taken] Continued Fractions C++ [<a href="ACA/ACA_numeric_continued_frac.pdf">description</a>]</li>
 <li> OpenCRun [<a href="ACA/OpenCRun-project.pdf">description</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Computer Architectures - Reading Assignments</h3>
<p>Reading Assignments have been listed in the official spreadsheet shared among all students.
Such projects require to produce a survey about a given topic.
At the end of the project students should produce a report and present it.</p>
<p>Report template (TeX) can be found <a href="ACA/ACA_RAR_Template.zip">here</a></p>

\subsection*{Why this paper is interesting}
This paper highlights the benefits of the approach based on electric oven over the traditional oven to cook lasagna.
It also features a very good related works section. Yeah, cool but no more than a couple of lines to write here.

\subsection*{Approach classification and scope}
baking methodologies
The proposed solution applies only to lasagna and not to generic cuisine.

\subsection*{Technologies involved}
Electric oven and traditional oven.

\subsection*{Innovation}
The innovation of this approach consists in using the electric oven to precook pasta for lasagna before cooking the lasagna in the traditional oven.

\subsection*{Benchmarks and metrics}
Cooking benchmarks. In particular, lasagna benchmark.
Metrics based on how good lasagna tastes.

\subsection*{Comments}
It looks strange to me, as pasta for lasagna should be precooked in water and not in the oven. However, there is no reference to water-cooking in this paper.

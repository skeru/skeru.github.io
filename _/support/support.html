<h1>[Personal Interests] Stefano Cherubin</h1>
<p><a href="../../index.html">Back to main page</a></p>

<p>If you are reading this page and you are looking for my personal interests, it probably means you don't have enough work to do. In this case, please check out <a href="../proposals/proposals.html">here</a> possible project ideas to better spend your time.</p>

<p>Here you can find a non-exaustive list of associations and activites I personally decided to support:</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>Highland Titles Nature Reserves</b>
	(<a href="https://www.highlandtitles.com">website</a>)
  <br/>
	Buy a plot of land and gain a Lordship/Ladyship/Lairdship title.
	By doing that you will help volunteers of natural reserves to maintain their forest.
  <br/>
	I visited my own plot of land in Scotland and it was a great naturalistic experience.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</b>
	(<a href="https://www.venganza.org/about/">learn more</a>)
  <br/>
	My religious and cooking beliefs
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can find a non-exaustive list of my <b>favourite quotes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <i>"Science is not democratic."</i> (Piero Angela)
</li>
</ul>

<p>I collected peculiarities of my 2017 journeys in a diary (written in Italian), which is currently on sale on <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Diario-K2017-Esperienze-umani-Europa/dp/1973278960/">Amazon</a>.</p>
